                    <p class="lead mt-4" style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: 475;">
                        3 years of industry experience building end-to-end machine learning pipelines and working with data visualization, processing, dashboarding, and deployment via cloud tools. I am extremely passionate about machine learning & data science, and I hope to pursure a PhD one day related to neuroinformatics - the application of data science to decode the data generated by the human brain.

                        For most of our lives we take for granted how naturally our brains provide us with the trustworthy decryption of our incoming sensory stimuli and how effortlessly it supplies us with memories. Without consistent decryption we would be unable to communicate or collaborate effectively as we each navigate our personal delusions. Without our memories not only would we fail to sustain organized thought, but we would also not know who or even what we are. We perceive the world, and we remember the world.
                    </p><p class="lead mt-4" style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 475;">
                        The brain has always fascinated me, and from a young age I wondered whether humanity would go outwards to explore the stars, or inward to explore our minds. However, I was initially naive about the stability of this reality-generating engine. As I grew I became aware of the myriad afflictions caused by electrical and chemical malfunctions and understood the fragility of being human. For the first time in history, we are beginning to unlock the power to reverse engineer the brainâ€™s mechanisms.. With this ability we can support and even cure or enhance previously untreatable ailments that were left to guesswork and many times surrender.
                    </p><p class="lead mt-4" style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 475;">
                        But not only do we perceive and remember the world, we also interact with it. Millions of individuals today suffer from the inability to properly execute their desired actions, stripping them of their human abilities. Neurotechnology could allow us to bypass or support the failing mechanisms to restore this functionality. Furthermore, as A.I. advances many fear we will no longer be the only, or even most, intelligent beings interacting with the world. The true power of A.I. can be realized by interfacing with it in the most natural of ways - via pure thought.
                    </p><p class="lead mt-4" style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 475;">
                        Humans have rarely been able to predict how new technologies will be used, and when it comes to the engineering of tools interfacing with the mind even the most imaginative of us will find themselves unable to truly comprehend the possibilities. As we develop, we find ourselves delicately navigating around innumerable treacherous futures. Yet, if we manage to succeed, the rewards will propel humanity into a renaissance of health and freedom from sources long considered out of our control. The foundations of what we now call reality may show themselves to be more malleable than we ever realized.
