                        Every experience you have ever had, every memory, thought, and dream, was conjured up between your left ear and your right ear. Scientists have been working for centuries to understand the human brain, philosophers and mystics for far longer.
                        <br><br>
                        How might intelligence manifest in processes other than neuronal activity?<br>
                        What desires is the brain fulfilling? Where do those desires and intentions originate from? How can we ensure that superintelligent systems fulfill those same desires? Should they?<br>
                        How can the world be understood objectively if it can only ever be understood through perception, that is to say subjectively? Can we truly say an objective universe even exists?<br>
                        If we send a fabricated stream of electrical activity to the CNS, will a new reality be generated? Is that reality any less real than the one generated from the electrical activity of sensory organs?<br>
                        <br>
                        Previously left to the domain of science fiction writers and Hollywood, these questions are beginning to become excitingly topical to modern science.
